# Local LLM + RAG Mini Project
- I was curious about LLMs and wanted to try it locally, so I built this CLI LLM + RAG Project
- I tried a LLM + RAG on the book that I am currently reading (The hard thing about hard things)
- Nothing fancy. 
- I used the Langchain - Ollama llama3.2 light weight model + Vectorisation + Chroma DB
